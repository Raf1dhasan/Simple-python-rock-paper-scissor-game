# Simple Python Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game using Python. The project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts and provides a fun, interactive command-line game.

## About the Project

The **Rock-Paper-Scissors Game** was created to:
- Practice fundamental Python concepts like conditional statements, loops, and user input.
- Create a simple, interactive console-based game.
- Serve as a beginner-friendly project to demonstrate Python programming.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script in your terminal.
2. Choose one of the options: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
3. The program will randomly select an option for the computer.
4. The winner is determined based on the rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
5. Play as many rounds as you like!

## Features
- Interactive user input for gameplay.
- Randomized computer choices using Python's `random` module.
- A simple and clear scoring system to track wins, losses, and ties.

## What I Did
- **Game Logic**:
  - Implemented the logic for determining winners using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements.
- **User Interaction**:
  - Used Python's `input()` function to gather user choices.
- **Randomization**:
  - Leveraged the `random.choice()` method to simulate computer decisions.
- **Code Structuring**:
  - Wrote clean, readable, and beginner-friendly Python code.

## What I Learned
- Improved understanding of Python basics such as:
  - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
  - Loops (`while` loop for replay functionality).
  - Working with Python modules like `random`.
- Gained experience in creating interactive command-line programs.
- Practiced structuring small Python scripts for readability and maintainability.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
